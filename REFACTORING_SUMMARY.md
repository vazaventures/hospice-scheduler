# Auto Schedule Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored `autoScheduleVisits.js` from a monolithic structure to a modular, scalable architecture while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Modular Structure
- **New Directory**: `src/autoSchedule/`
- **Modular Files**:
  - `rn.js` - RN visit logic (14-day intervals, recertification)
  - `np.js` - NP visit logic (BP3+ requirements)
  - `hope.js` - HOPE visit logic (HUV1/HUV2, attach to RN or standalone)
  - `lvn.js` - LVN visit logic (varying weekly frequencies)
  - `utils.js` - Common utility functions
  - `index.js` - Module exports
  - `README.md` - Documentation

### 2. Preserved Existing Functionality
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing imports continue to work
- **Visit State Shape**: Maintained existing visit object structure
- **UI Compatibility**: No breaking changes to the user interface
- **API Compatibility**: All public functions maintain their signatures

### 3. Enhanced Visit Logic
- **RN Visits**: Generate only 1 suggested visit per patient if none exists within 14 days
- **Recertification**: Add "recert" tag if visit is within 14 days of benefit period rollover
- **NP Visits**: Required at start of BP3 or higher, or on admission if BP3+
- **HOPE Visits**: HUV1 (days 6-15) and HUV2 (days 16-30) with smart attachment logic
- **LVN Visits**: Weekly frequencies vary by patient with proper scheduling

### 4. Added Status Field
- All generated visits now include a `status` field ("suggested" or "confirmed")
- Maintains existing visit state merging logic

### 5. Improved Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each visit type has its own focused module
- **Reusability**: Common functions extracted to utils module
- **Maintainability**: Clear module boundaries and documentation
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new visit types or modify existing ones

## File Structure
```
src/
├── autoSchedule/
│   ├── rn.js          # RN visit scheduling
│   ├── np.js          # NP visit scheduling  
│   ├── hope.js        # HOPE visit scheduling
│   ├── lvn.js         # LVN visit scheduling
│   ├── utils.js       # Common utilities
│   ├── index.js       # Module exports
│   └── README.md      # Documentation
└── autoScheduleVisits.js  # Main orchestrator (refactored)
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each visit type logic is isolated and focused
2. **Testability**: Individual modules can be tested independently
3. **Readability**: Clear separation makes code easier to understand
4. **Scalability**: New visit types can be added without modifying existing code
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README for future developers

## Verification
- ✅ All modules have valid syntax
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Existing UI continues to work
- ✅ Visit state shape preserved

## Future Development
The modular structure makes it easy for future developers to:
- Add new visit types by creating new modules
- Modify existing visit logic without affecting other types
- Test individual components independently
- Understand the codebase through clear documentation
