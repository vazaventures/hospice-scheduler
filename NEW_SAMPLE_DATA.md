- **LVN Module**: Frequency-based scheduling (2x/week vs 3x/week)

### 2. Visit Status Tracking
- All visits include `status: "suggested"` field
- Proper priority levels (urgent, high, medium)
- Comprehensive tagging system

### 3. Diverse Patient Scenarios
- Different benefit periods (BP1, BP2, BP3)
- Various visit frequencies (2x/week, 3x/week)
- Mix of overdue, due, and upcoming visits
- HOPE tool integration

### 4. Staff Assignment Logic
- RN assignments based on patient load
- LVN assignments by frequency requirements
- NP assignments for BP3+ patients
- Proper discipline-specific scheduling
